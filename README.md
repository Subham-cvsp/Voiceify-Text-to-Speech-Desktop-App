# Voiceify-Text-to-Speech-Desktop-App
Voiceify is a Python-based desktop application that converts user-entered text into speech using Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS). It features a sleek dark-themed GUI, the ability to save speech as MP3, and integration with the ZenQuotes API to fetch and speak motivational quotes in real-time â€” all without using a microphone.
